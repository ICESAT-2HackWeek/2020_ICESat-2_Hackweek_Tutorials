But this version of the tutorial aims to be 100% reproducible by being executed directly as an IPython notebook and is hosted itself on github so that others can more easily make improvements to it by collaborating on Github.  Many thanks to John and Emanuele for making their materials available online.\n",

It has a similar spirit to this one, and is part of his excellent series [Lectures on Scientific Computing with Python](https://github.com/jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures) that is entirely available as Jupyter Notebooks."

But most scientists start working alone with a few files or with a small team, so I feel it's important to build first the key concepts and practices based on problems scientists encounter in their everyday life and without the jargon of the software world.  Once you've become familiar with 1-4, the excellent tutorials that exist about collaborating on github on open-source projects should make sense."
