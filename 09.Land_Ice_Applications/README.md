# Land ice applications: Getting familiar with ICESat-2 products over land ice

## 1. Introduction
In this tutorial, we're going to take a first look at some of the ICESat-2 data over land ice.  We're going to demonstrate how ALT06 segments correspond to ATL03 photons, and demonstrate the repeat-track structure of ATL06 data. '

## 1.1 Learning goals
Our learning goals include understanding:
* how ice-sheet surfaces are represented by ATL03 photons
* how ATL06 elevations correpond to ATL03 photon clouds
* how small-scale features appear in ATL06
* the repeat structure of ATL06
* how cross-track slope can affect elevation differences
and we'll also give:
* a sneak peak at the ATL11 product.

## 1.2 Tools presented and developed:
Along the way, we'll present:
* A reader for ATL03
* A reader for ATL06
* Geographic projections with pyproj
* Filtering ATL06 elevations using slope and quality parameters
* Mapping surface elevations and profiles with matplotlib
* Visualizing ATL03 and ATL06 together.
