## Generation of science data from ICESat-2 

Instructor: Johan Nilsson (johan.nilsson@jpl.nasa.gov)

This tutorial presents a simple workflow that is useful to generate elevation change rates, time series and digital elevation models from ICESat-2. It further demonstrates how these different products are gridded, filtered and quality checked to obtain results of high quality.

The algorithms used in this tutorial is the culmination of several yearsâ€™ worth of effort to provide the cryosphere community a simple to use framework for the most common tasks in altimetry data processing. They are constantly being updated and improved upon so please feel free to reach out if you have questions or if something is not working properly.
