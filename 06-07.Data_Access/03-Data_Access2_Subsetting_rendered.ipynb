    "This notebook illustrates the use of `icepyx` for subsetting ICESat-2 data ordered through the NSIDC DAAC. We'll show how to find out what subsetting options are available and how to specify the subsetting options for your order.\n",

    "### _What is SUBSETTING anyway?_\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyone who's worked with geospatial data has probably encountered subsetting. Typically, we search for data wherever it is stored and download the chunks (aka granules, scenes, passes, swaths, etc.) that contain something we are interested in. Then, we have to extract from each chunk the pieces we actually want to analyze. Those pieces might be geospatial (i.e. an area of interest), temporal (i.e. certain months of a time series), and/or certain variables. This process of extracting the data we are going to use is called subsetting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of ICESat-2 data coming from the NSIDC DAAC, we can do this subsetting step on the data prior to download, reducing our number of data processing steps and resulting in smaller, faster downloads and storage."

When you use that spatial information for subsetting, it's actually asking the NSIDC subsetter to extract the appropriate data from each granule. Thus, even if you set `subset=False` and download entire granules, you still need to provide some inputs on what geographic area you'd like data for."

    "Sometimes, granules (\"files\") returned in our initial search end up not containing any data in our specified area of interest. This is because the initial search is completed using summary metadata for a granule. You've likely encountered this before when viewing available imagery online: your spatial search turns up a bunch of images with only a few border or corner pixels, maybe even in no data regions, in your area of interest. Thus, when you go to extract the data from the area you want (i.e. spatially subset it), you don't get any usable data from that image. Note that as of June 2020 this error message produced by the NSIDC subsetter is currently being modified to reflect this behavior as more of an informational warning as opposed to an error. "
